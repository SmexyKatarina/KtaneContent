					<p>On the module, there are eight lettered dots, representing people. There are also arrows between each person, representing who they visited that night. Based on their position on their module, find who each person on the module is and do the right things that are necessary.</p>
					<p>This table tells you each person’s “role”. For each person on the module, look at the letter on the dot and the correct column. Use the first column if you are checking someone on the top row. Use the second column if you are checking someone on the bottom row. Use the third column if you are checking someone on the right side. Use the fourth column otherwise.</p>

					<p>When you are ready, click on the moon.</p>
					<p>Click on any person to submit their answers. Upon clicking, a menu will open up. You will have to click
						their role, and then send all appropriate night status “messages” based on what happened to them that night,
						in the order they are given in the list below.</p>
					<p>Messages include:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>“You were jailed!”</li>
						<li>“You were attacked and healed by a doctor!”</li>
						<li>“You were attacked and protected by a bodyguard!”</li>
						<li>“You were attacked and healed by a Guardian Angel!”</li>
						<li>“You were attacked but your defense was too strong!” (For roles that can survive attacks on their own)
						</li>
						<li>“You were role-blocked!” (For escorts and consorts) or “Your target was in jail!”</li>
						<li>“You were converted by a vampire!”</li>
						<li value="0">“You are dead!”</li>
					</ol>
					<p>Most roles also have their own role-specific messages. Refer to the appendix for those. Repeat this process
						to <strong>any</strong> 3 people in order to solve the module.</p>
